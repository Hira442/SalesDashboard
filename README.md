Project Overview: Interactive Sales Dashboard in Excel

Business Problem

Our client provided a dataset containing sales information with the objective of gaining insights into key aspects of their business. Specifically, they sought to understand the following:

Which customers are driving the most revenue?

What product categories are generating the highest sales?

Which specific products are top performers in terms of volume and revenue?


By analyzing these areas, the client aims to make data-driven decisions to optimize their sales strategy, target top customers, and focus on high-performing categories and products.

Process Overview

1.⁠ ⁠Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Inspected and cleaned the dataset for missing or inconsistent data.

Applied formatting and ensured that the data was structured properly for analysis.



2.⁠ ⁠Inserting Pivot Tables:

Created dynamic pivot tables to summarize and categorize the data by customer, category, and product.

Pivot tables were used to track key metrics such as total sales, product volume, and revenue per customer.



3.⁠ ⁠Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Designed an interactive dashboard using Excel's visualization tools to display the insights obtained from the pivot tables.

Integrated visual elements like charts, graphs, and slicers for easy filtering and real-time interaction with the data.

The dashboard allows users to explore sales trends, identify top customers, and track the performance of product categories.




This project effectively provides the client with a comprehensive view of their sales landscape, empowering them to make informed decisions backed by data insights.
